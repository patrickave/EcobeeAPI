# What is this?
  - Simple project to force myself to use python to access API
  - This project accesses the Ecobee (Smart Thermostat) API and pulls information for my own thermostat
  - After it pulls the info, it stores it in a MySQL Database

# Future Plans:
  - Maybe create a Django website and chart out the data using nodeJS
